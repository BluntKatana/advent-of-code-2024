# advent-of-code-2024

Code is looking ugly and non-performant in some places, will see whether I clean it up or not.

Written in typescript using Bun :)

## Todo

- day 16 part 2
- day 17 part 2
- day 19 part 2 (doable)

## How to run

```bash
bun install
bun run day-<dayNum>/part<partNum>.ts
```

In each part you can choose to import the `input.txt` or `example.txt` file. Where `input.txt` is the actual input and `example.txt` is the example input give in most of the problems.
